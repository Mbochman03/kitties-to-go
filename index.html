        <h3>The Kitties to Go Story</h3>
        <p>Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage good now the other hand, too but <a href="#">refuse to drink water</a> except out of someone's glass. Stare at guinea pigs scratch at the door then walk away yet jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed. Lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty purr while eating cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back. I'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out.</p>
        <p>Guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! pet me pet me don't pet me or present belly, scratch hand when stroked instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason yet why must they do that, and hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy or trip on catnip.</p>
